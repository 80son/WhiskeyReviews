Nose: Sweet with a hint of apple as well as dulce de leche.

Palate: There's some burn but very soft.  Hits like a warm apple crisp.

Finish: Nothing very noteworthy.  There are some tannins but they're very quick.

Conclusion: Simple - a start.  Perhaps something to come back to now that the standard has been established.

Final Score: 68.

Scoring Legend:  
* 96-100: The perfect dram, nectar of the gods.  
* 90-95: Near perfect, there is something truly special about this whisky.  
* 85-89: Amazing, will always try to keep a bottle of this in my collection (if feasible).  
* 80-84: Very Good, maybe only one minor nitpick about the whisky keeping it here.  
* 75-79: Good, quite enjoyable to drink.  
* 70-74: Solid, wouldn't go out of my way to get it.  
* 60-69: Meh, still drinkable.  
* Below 59: If you have a bottle of this, start cooking with it instead.
